The Kroxylicious project is very pleased to announce the release of [Kroxylicious 0.8.0](https://github.com/kroxylicious/kroxylicious/releases/tag/v0.8.0). See the [Changelog](https://github.com/kroxylicious/kroxylicious/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#080) for a list of changes and summary of Deprecations, Changes and Removals.

### Security Fix

We discovered that when Kroxylicious is connecting to a proxied cluster using TLS, it does not verify that the hostname we are connecting to matches a name from the upstream certificate.
In this release we have enabled this verification by default.

This is being released as a minor version change rather than 0.7.1 because we follow the Semantic Versioning of our publicly supported `kroxylicious-api` jar.

### Artefacts

You'll find binaries attached to the GitHub [release](https://github.com/kroxylicious/kroxylicious/releases/tag/v0.8.0), and available through [Maven Central](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/kroxylicious/kroxylicious-app/0.8.0/).

Docker images are hosted at [quay.io/kroxylicious/kroxylicious](https://quay.io/repository/kroxylicious/kroxylicious)
